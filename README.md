# History
Prior to the release of Elden Ring, the release versions of FromSoft titles contained multiple P2P exploits, that ranged in severity - from allowing cheating due to insufficient checks, to being able to crash other clients, to RCE.  
During the development of Blue Sentinel (Dark Souls III) and Blue Acolyte (Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin), many of those were patched, and released as de-facto community patches, without detailing most of the protection capabilities.  
Many of these bugs were reported to both Bandai Namco and FromSoft directly during the course of development. Some Bandai Namco support personnel were contacted directly, and admitted that (paraphrasing) "the report tickets go nowhere".  
After Elden Ring's Closed Network Test, the binaries were dumped from a PlayStation 4 - and after examination - were found to contain the same vulnerabilities. **Left unattended, this would've opened millions of players to abuse.**  
After [tremwil's RCE demonstration](https://github.com/tremwil/ds3-nrssr-rce), and the subsequent takedown of the Souls games, the community manager for Elden Ring from Bandai Namco, Izmar, was contacted in the hopes of amending that situation.  
The documents in this repo were made after the fact, tracing back and summarizing all the knowledge from Blue Sentinel, and after that - Blue Acolyte. The documents were delivered to FromSoft, and many of the fixes suggested were implemented in the release version of Elden Ring.  
The original games themselves had a majority of fixes implemented as well, in the year following Elden Ring's release.

# Reasoning
During the development of Blue Acolyte and Blue Sentinel, there were many speculations from the community regarding what they did exactly, and many accusations regarding them being nefarious.  
These documents are being released to explain what the protections in the mods were. These can be validated against the respective versions of the games.  
This is both a trust-building measure and satisfying the users' right to know what they ran - both from the mods, and the software they attempt to fix.
